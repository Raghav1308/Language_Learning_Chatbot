The Language Learning Chatbot represents an advanced application of artificial intelligence (AI) and natural language processing (NLP) to facilitate second-language acquisition through interactive, scenario-based dialogue. By leveraging state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) and structured data storage, this system provides dynamic conversational feedback, real-time linguistic corrections, and personalized learning pathways tailored to individual proficiency levels. The chatbot is designed to systematically track linguistic errors, store them for future reference, and offer targeted pedagogical interventions to enhance the userâ€™s language proficiency.
